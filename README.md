## ðŸ“– About the project
Project developed as part of a code/project challenge at DIO, as part of the BootCamp: "PotÃªncia Tech iFood - Game Development". <br>
The project was based on a virtual piano, whose keyboard has several keys capable of producing different sounds. Not only that, but the keyboard also has a volume control, an option to show or hide the piano key guidance corresponding to the PC keyboard keys. Furthermore, it also includes options for filters/equalizers. The project is responsive for mobile devices and utilizes the Web Audio API to implement the equalizers.
